Update (24 April 2021): Readded support for "Convolution EQ", select correct sample rate in the program.

For converting Equalizer Apo (or Peace) config to CSV for AutoEQ. This makes it possible to generate Graphic Eq for Wavelet (Non-Root Android Eq) and others. https://i.imgur.com/O6lKxec.png

Before use, please download python and get pip: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows

After you got pip working, Press Code->Download zip and extract.

How to use:

1. Open rungui.bat or runguipeace.bat if you use Peace
2. Select folder of EqualizerAPO installation
3. Select the device which have the eq on
4. Select device sample rate (when in doubt just choose 48000).
5. Press OK
6. Wait until the program closes
7. Take the GraphicEQ.txt file and import to wavelet

Please report any issues you encountered. Any contributions to improve the GUI will be appreciated. This GUI currently works for Parametric EQ and Convolution EQ in APO without any non-filter or preamp commands (Copy, delay, etc).
