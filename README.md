Update (22 April 2021): New method fixes bug with <20Hz. Currently not supporting "convolution eq"

For converting Equalizer Apo (or Peace) config to CSV for AutoEQ. This makes it possible to generate Graphic Eq for Wavelet (Non-Root Android Eq) and others. https://i.imgur.com/fjK8muf.png

Before use, please download python and get pip: https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-pip-windows

After you got pip working, Press Code->Download zip and extract.

How to use:

Open rungui.bat or runguipeace.bat if you use Peace
Select folder of EqualizerAPO installation
Select the device which have the eq on
Press OK
Wait until the program closes
Take the GraphicEQ.txt file and import to wavelet
Please report any issues you encountered. Any contributions to improve the GUI will be appreciated. This GUI currently works for Parametric EQ and Convolution EQ in APO without any non-filter or preamp commands (Copy, delay, etc).
